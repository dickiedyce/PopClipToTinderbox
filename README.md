# PopClipToTinderbox

A PopClip extension that saves a selected snippet of text (via PopClip) into a
specific Tinderbox file (WorkingMemory.tbx) as a new note. If the clip was
taken from a web page it names the note after the page title, adds a
timestamp, and sets the note's SourceURL attribute to the page's url.
